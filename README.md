# spotifyClone---Basic-Frontend-Clone
🎧 Spotify Clone (Basic Web Version) This is a basic frontend clone of Spotify, built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the look and functionality of a music streaming app with features like play/pause, next/previous track controls, progress bar, and a dynamic playlist UI — all without using any external frameworks.
